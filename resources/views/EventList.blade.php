    </div>

    <h4>Basic concepts and motivation</h4>
    <p>When people use mobile sensing systems as instruments in such research, we call it participatory sensing. 
    The study will highlight associated preconditions and strategies to address the problem of low adoption 
    of PS in Kenya. In the last few years, most countries all over the world have adopted participatory 
    sensing applications as a new approach to offer location based services to mobile users. 
    Such application include GPS enabled devices, such as smartphones,, iPad, and Google Glasses are used in
    massive data collection i.e., mobile users collect useful data of real time happenings and upload to be 
    used by consumers.
    Participatory sensing applications focus on the collection of data about the users and their environment 
    using mobile phones with embedded sensors, such as accelerometers, cameras, and microphones. The sensors 
    are either embedded in smart phones regulated by individual citizens or owned by private companies e.g.,
    closed-circuit television cameras; alternatively installed by urban authorities and utility companies,
    such as traffic detectors and water meters. , (Christin, Buchner, & Leibecke, 2013; Manzoor et al., 2013;
    Tarquini & Morgano, 2013) pointed out, there wide range application has mobilized citizens, organizations
    and governments, which have become increasingly attractive to utilize any available data to solve real 
    world problems, generate economic activities and timely response to disasters. These applications can 
    improve the life quality of millions of potential users. Example applications include monitoring diets, 
    road and traffic conditions, and noise pollution, (Macias, Suarez, & Lloret, 2013). The process involves
    a group of mobile users register to a participatory sensing server that receives sensing tasks from
    either a local or online task administrator. Despite the stable growth of participatory sensing 
    application worldwide, there is still little understanding of participatory sensing adoption 
    and users experiences in other countries, especially developing countries in Africa. These few 
    research efforts have provided valuable findings and lessons for improving users’ experiences
    and adoption; however, the participants in all of these studies were drawn in the U.S., Europe
    and Asia (Chessa et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2012; Marusic, Gubbi, Sullivan, Law, & Palaniswami, 2014). 
    The extent to which these findings about adoption and experiences generalize to other regions,
    such as East Africa, is still largely neither unaccounted nor unknown.
    Adopting a new approach such as participatory sensing applications to offer practical solutions such as
    domain of transportation system, health sensing, environmental and disaster management etc. would definitely
    require components different from the traditional conventional efforts (Shilton et al., 2006).
    </p>

    <h4>Problem statement</h4> 
    <p>Previous studies on participatory Sensing tasks in real world deployment have targeted data samples mainly 
    from developed countries and East Asia (Chessa, 2016; Lin J, 2012; Marusic, 2014). Typically, there is no
    explicit research for low usage and adoption of participatory sensing application in Kenya and other developing 
    countries in Africa, yet millions of smartphones are shipped to these countries every year (IDC, 2015).
    Kenya currently is experiencing increasing pressure regarding resources and urban infrastructure, health, 
    disaster and environmental management. Governments and private institutions implement strategic plans with 
    intentions of improving the quality of life for their citizens. There is the potential to greatly enhance
    these institutions operations in efficient management and response as well as a regulatory framework by 
    exploring emerging technologies for data gathering. There is need of making community involvement in
    participatory sensing a well-established practice in Kenya.

    <h4>Identification of stakeholders</h4>
    <p>Nairobi city has experienced rapid growth in population occasioned by urbanization; experiencing related challenges
    in provision of basic urban services such roads infrastructure, health care, environmental management and disaster 
    response etc.
    The government’s role in provision of affordable services to its citizens by looking into areas such as the following:
    policy and legislation creation; enforcement; financing; awareness creation and campaigning; industry participation;
    and accreditation; monitoring, auditing and evaluation; skills development; and technology transfer.
    In identifying preconditions for successful implementation and strategy, public government agencies responsible
    for environmental issues, disaster response, healthcare and roads infrastructure such as the National Environmental 
    Management Authority (NEMA), Nairobi county, National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) and Ministry of Health,
    are responsible for formulating and enforcing Policies in corresponding sensing domain for the citizens. With regard
    to sensing domain it will focus on preconditions in four domains namely road infrastructure, healthcare, 
    and environment and disaster management by various public and private agencies.
    </p>
    <h4>Justification of the study</h4>
    <p>Kenya is the largest economy in East Africa with 31,985,048 Internet users as of September, 2015 up from 3,995,500 
    representing 74.2 % up from 69.6% of the population, according to Communication Authority of Kenya (CAK) (Analysis, 2016). Since this number is increasing at remarkable rate, it makes cell phones an admirable platform for sensing phenomena in the country. Generally speaking, EA Africa has different environment such as cultural issues, level of technological advancement, policy environment etc. from the developed countries such as Europe, USA and emerging economies such as China.
    Kenya has a poor track record of road infrastructure mainly due to maintenance by relevant authorities, response
    to emergence or disaster, environmental issues (e.g., e-waste) and health care (Makau et al., 2012). Yet the country
    has potential to mobilize citizens, public and private sectors to harness the power of new technology to facilitate
    collection of large volumes of diverse information for solving real life problems. The new generation cell phones
    have multiple embedded sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, light, video, microphone, etc.) and can easily 
    communicate with external sensors via any of the built-in interfaces including blue tooth, infrared or WiFi
    (Tilak, 2013).
    A study carried out by (Occasional, Series, Africa, & Parks, 2015) in Kenya found out that Bandwidth is wanting
    since the first undersea cable to bring broadband internet access to East Africa –Seacom – went live in 2009.
    However, Coastal regions have benefitted from undersea cable developments, but the continent’s interior remains
    gravely underserved since there is inadequate infrastructure interlinking coastal and inland areas. 
    Terrestrial infrastructures are costly to develop and take time to build. In addition, when they are built,
    these facilities are often subject to theft, damage, and vandalism.

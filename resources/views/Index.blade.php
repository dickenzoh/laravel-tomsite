            <h3>Abstract</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="mx-auto">In the last few years, most countries have adopted participatory sensing applications as a new approach
             to offer location-based services to mobile users. Mobile sensing includes categories such as individual,
             participatory, crowd, social, etc. Participatory sensing applications focus on the collection of data
              about the users and their environment using GPS-enabled mobile devices with embedded sensors, such 
              as accelerometers, cameras, and microphones. Their wide range of application has mobilized citizens, 
              organizations and governments, which have become increasingly attracted to utilizing any available data 
              to solve real world problems, generate economic activities and timely response to disasters. 
              These applications can improve the life quality of millions of potential users in areas such as
               monitoring diets, road and traffic conditions, noise pollution, environmental and emergence response 
               such as fire. Users of GPS-enabled devices such as smartphones, iPads and Google Glasses engage in
                massive data collection of real time happenings and upload the same to be used by consumers. 
             Despite technological advancements such as sensing networks using mobile phones, the deployment 
             of participatory sensing to solve real world issues for instance urbanization challenges such as 
             transport infrastructure, environmental management, disasters and health care remain low in developing
             countries especially Kenya. The government, private sector and citizens living in developing countries 
             are still experiencing implementation challenges towards full utilization of participatory sensing.

            <h3>Background to the research </h3>
        </div>
        <p class="mx-auto">When people use mobile sensing systems as instruments in such research, we call it 
            participatory sensing. 
         The study will highlight associated preconditions and strategies to address the problem of low adoption 
        of PS in Kenya. In the last few years, most countries all over the world have adopted participatory sensing
        applications as a new approach to offer location based services to mobile users. Such application include GPS
        enabled devices, such as smartphones,, iPad, and Google Glasses are used in massive data collection i.e., mobile
         users collect useful data of real time happenings and upload to be used by consumers.
